# Production-ready Spring Boot REST API (Fintech Focus)

> Tailored repo README + checklist for building production-ready REST APIs in the **Fintech domain**. Includes sequential mini-projects to practice essential concepts — from building core business logic to deploying and scaling APIs.

---

## 1 — Project overview

Short description: A production-ready Spring Boot REST API starter, extended with **Fintech-focused mini-projects** covering user accounts, payments, wallets, loans, fraud detection, and scaling. Each mini-project is scoped for \~1 week and contributes toward mastering production-grade fintech APIs.

---

Below are **six fintech-themed mini-projects**, arranged in increasing complexity. Completing them sequentially helps you build up from fundamentals to a deployable, scalable fintech platform.

### Project 1 — Digital Wallet & User Accounts (Week 1)

**Objective:** Build the foundation with user registration, authentication, and wallet balances.

**Core tasks:**

* Entities: `User`, `Wallet`.
* Implement user registration/login with JWT and roles.
* Initialize wallet balance on account creation.
* Basic transfer API between wallets.
* Tests for balance updates.
* Deploy locally with Docker + Postgres.

**Concepts learned / outcomes:** Authentication, wallet ledger basics, DTO validation, CI setup, and local deployments.

---

### Project 2 — Transaction Service & Ledger Integrity (Week 2)

**Objective:** Implement reliable transactions with audit trails.

**Core tasks:**

* Entity: `Transaction` (credit, debit).
* Ensure transactional integrity for money transfers.
* Maintain ledger consistency with double-entry accounting.
* Pagination and filtering of transactions.
* Concurrency handling (optimistic locking).

**Concepts learned / outcomes:** Transaction management, financial audit logs, idempotency, concurrency handling.

---

### Project 3 — Payment Gateway Integration (Week 3)

**Objective:** Connect with external payment APIs (e.g., Stripe/Razorpay sandbox).

**Core tasks:**

* Integrate third-party payment API (sandbox).
* Webhook handling for payment success/failure.
* Secure secret management for API keys.
* Retry mechanism for failed callbacks.

**Concepts learned / outcomes:** External API integration, webhook security, secrets handling, retries, and CI/CD.

---

### Project 4 — Micro-loans & Credit Scoring (Week 4)

**Objective:** Add micro-loan functionality with simple credit scoring logic.

**Core tasks:**

* Entities: `Loan`, `RepaymentSchedule`.
* Basic loan request/approval API.
* Simple rule-based credit scoring engine.
* Scheduled job for repayment reminders.

**Concepts learned / outcomes:** Business rules engine, scheduled tasks, financial calculations, lending workflows.

---

### Project 5 — Fraud Detection & Alerts (Week 5)

**Objective:** Add fraud detection logic for transactions and trigger alerts.

**Core tasks:**

* Define fraud rules (e.g., sudden large transfers, geo anomalies).
* Real-time fraud check on transactions.
* Alerts via email/SMS (use sandbox service).
* Store fraud cases for review.

**Concepts learned / outcomes:** Rule-based fraud detection, event-driven alerts, notifications, monitoring suspicious activity.

---

### Project 6 — Scaling & Observability (Week 6)

**Objective:** Prepare for production scale and reliability.

**Core tasks:**

* Add Redis caching for wallet lookups.
* Rate limiting for APIs.
* Expose Prometheus metrics (transactions/sec, fraud alerts).
* Grafana dashboards and alerts.
* Blue-green deployment strategy.

**Concepts learned / outcomes:** Caching, API rate limiting, observability, monitoring, scaling strategies, deployment resilience.

## 19 — How to use these mini-projects

* **Sequential approach:** Start from wallets → transactions → payments → loans → fraud detection → scaling.
* **Focus on outcomes:** Each week produces a working service with deployable artifacts.
* **Document everything:** Write short design notes after each project.
* **Integrate gradually:** By the end, you’ll have the foundation of a fintech API platform.
